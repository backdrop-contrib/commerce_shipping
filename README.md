# Commerce Shipping

Commerce Shipping provides a shipping rate calculation system for Backdrop
Commerce, integrating shipping service selection into both the checkout form and
order edit form. This module is a framework that is meant to be used in
conjunction with shipping method modules like Commerce Flat Rate, Commerce UPS,
and others.

Shipping service availability and rate calculation is handled in the user
interface through Rules and is backed up by an API that gives you a high level
of flexibility to implement simple or complex shipping scenarios.

## Developer documentation

Documentation for developers can be found in the example module included in the
project. It demonstrates how to define a shipping method and how to collect
additional information from the user on the checkout form. If you use it as a
starting point for your shipping method module, you should copy it to a new
folder and rename it so you can continue to update Commerce Shipping 2.x as new
releases are created.

The API documentation is currently inline and in commerce_shipping.api.php.
